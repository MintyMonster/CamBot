# Cambot 1.0
Cambot is a personal project of mine in which I tried to create a Discord bot with as many types of "Random" as humanly possible. However, I quickly ended up expanding Cambot into a fully working Discord bot.

# Features
 - Factual APIs such as Weather, ISS positioning and hubble imagery and much more.
 - Comedic API calls including DadJokes and Urban dictionary.
 - "For fun" API calls such as Fox images, Dog images and food recipes.
 - Full leaderboard and levelling system for those who use the bot the most.

# Disclaimer
This version of Cambot has currently been discontinued and a new better version is currently under development.
